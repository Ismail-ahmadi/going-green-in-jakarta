**Recycling** is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. It can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby reducing: energy usage, air pollution (from incineration), and water pollution (from landfilling).

**Upcycling** is the creative process of transforming by-products, waste materials, useless, or unwanted products into new attractive materials or products of better quality or for better environmental value. The term upcycle began to gain traction in the mid 90s. Then in 2002, William McDonough and Michael Braungart’s book ‘Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things’ brought the term into the public eye, and solidified its use in pop culture.
