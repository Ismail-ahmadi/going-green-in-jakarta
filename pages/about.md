# We are a Community

...of over two thousand people making positive changes to our lifestyles to reduce waste and generally live more environmentally friendly in Jakarta.

**OUR GOALS**

1. Helping more homes to reduce waste and dispose of it responsibly.
2. Collecting and sharing information about living a greener lifestyle in Jakarta. 
3. Using our consumer power to inform and encourage businesses in Jakarta to reduce waste.

Most of our discussions happen on the [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/GGJakarta/) group.

# The Jakarta Green List

We are excited to present the Jakarta Green List, which is your guide to green products, groceries, restaurants and leisure activities. Products, business, organisations or initiatives profiled are recognised for their efforts to be environmentally responsible. However, we do not guarantee or represent that they are completely environmentally responsible and Going Green in Jakarta assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of their claims.
