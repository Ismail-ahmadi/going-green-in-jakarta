questions:
  - answer: >-
      We are a new, fast growing community of individuals who want to do more to
      reduce plastic, recycle and generally live more environmentally friendly
      in this city.


      We began as a discussion on the wall of the Jakarta Moms Support Group in
      December 2017 and have quickly evolved into a lively facebook community
      (www.facebook.com/groups/GGJakarta) of over 1400 people (Indonesians and
      expats) dedicated to greener living.


      There is also an active WhatsApp group open to anyone who wants to be more
      involved in planning or running projects.
    question: Q1. What is Going Green in Jakarta?
  - answer: >
      Creating a longer term strategy and structure takes time. Since we’re so
      new, we have started by focusing on the 3 goals that came top in our FB
      poll that was run in January 2018.
       
           1. Helping more households dispose of waste responsibly by linking them to trash collectors 
               and organisations who recycle or upcycle.
           2. Collecting and sharing information about living green in Jakarta (e.g. shops, restaurants, 
                products, zero-waste lifestyle).
           3. Using our consumer power to encourage shops and other businesses in Jakarta to use 
               less plastic, and supporting relevant local campaigns.
       
      This will give us some time to figure out more organically how we want to
      function, how we best work together, etc before we come to any big
      decisions or start bigger projects that require more clarity on ways of
      working and where we’re going than we currently have.
    question: Q2. What are the group’s long term goals and plans?
  - answer: >-
      Our Facebook group is already a lively place for hosting discussion and
      sharing ideas and resources on how to live more green in Jakarta (e.g.
      composting, cleaning products, recycling, local campaigns, find plastic
      alternatives etc). It’s also become a space for asking questions on green
      living and planning meetups. We’ve also developed our first resources on
      how you can recycle in Jakarta and have launched this website with the
      Jakarta Green List in April 2019. We have also launched a campaign to
      reduce plastic packaging in supermarkets on Change.Org.
    question: Q3. What is the group doing right now?
  - answer: >
      Anyone in the group can initiate a project on behalf of Going Green in
      Jakarta so long as (i) it’s broadly in line with the group’s goals (see
      above) and (ii) other members are given the opportunity to give their
      input or be involved. Before starting a new group project, please consult
      one of the group’s coordinators first so that they can advise on any
      potential duplication and can keep an overview of all the group’s
      activities.
       
      In the interests of keeping this lovely and lively group all moving in the
      same direction, we have a few volunteers who are taking on coordination
      responsibilities so we can keep an overview of who’s doing what to avoid
      duplication, streamline communication and planning, and create some
      accountability. Right now our coordinators are…
       
              Facebook - Vics (admin), Aparna and Erou (moderators)
              Talks, outreach and local partnerships - Susan (English), Malini (English, Indonesian) and 
              Erou (English/Indonesian).
              Online campaigning - Zina
              Instagram - Savirra
              Website - Vics, Prachi and Divya
       
      These coordinators are responsible for ensuring we have a clear way of
      working. Coordinators won't be making decisions, more like facilitating
      the group to make decisions... and won't be doing all the work, more like
      keeping track of who's doing what and making sure people have the support
      they need for what they're working on.
    question: Q4. How is Going Green in Jakarta being coordinated?
  - answer: >-
      As a new community that is 100% driven by volunteers we are still finding
      our feet and our ways of working. As we grow, we aspire to live up to the
      following working principles. Where we fall short of these principles we
      will listen to feedback and commit to find ways of doing it better.
       
          1.  Open and inclusive - we are a diverse group of people living in Jakarta. We seek to create 
               a community that is sensitive to cultural differences and where all members are valued 
               for their passion, ideas and experience.
           2. Positive and solution-driven - we want to better understand the barriers to going green in 
               Jakarta but will work together to find solutions and generate new ideas to overcome 
               challenges.
           3. Collaborative and value-adding - we want to work together with established local 
               organisations and bodies who are already working on green issues and add 
               value/momentum to their work rather than duplicating.
          4.  Accountable and supportive. We will hold ourselves accountable to what we have 
               committed to, without putting undue stress or pressure on people who volunteer to take 
               on responsibilities or projects.
    question: Q5. What kind of community are we?
  - answer: >-
      The WA group is a way for communicating directly and quickly with a
      smaller team of people to better enable the establishment and development
      of Going Green in Jakarta. WA Group conversations are currently in English
      given the international demographic of members. Ask any of the
      coordinators if you would like to join. Anyone can be added to the
      Whatsapp group at anytime if they want to be involved on a day-to-day
      basis. We also understand that some people may decide to leave the WA
      group (for example, if they have less time to be active) but stay involved
      via the FB group.
