questions:
  - answer: >-
      We are a new, fast growing community of individuals who want to do more to
      reduce plastic, recycle and generally live more environmentally friendly
      in this city.


      <br />We began as a discussion on the wall of the Jakarta Moms Support
      Group in December 2017 and have quickly evolved into a lively facebook
      community (www.facebook.com/groups/GGJakarta) of over 1400 people
      (Indonesians and expats) dedicated to greener living.


      <br />There is also an active WhatsApp group open to anyone who wants to
      be more involved in planning or running projects.
    question: Q1. What is Going Green in Jakarta?
  - answer: >-
      Creating a longer term strategy and structure takes time. Since we’re so
      new, we have started by focusing on the 3 goals that came top in our FB
      poll that was run in January 2018.


      <br /> 1. Helping more households dispose of waste responsibly by linking
      them to trash collectors and oragnisations who recycle or upcylce.


      <br /> 2. Collecting and sharing information about living green in Jakarta
      (e.g. shops, restaurants, products, zero-waste lifestyle).


      <br /> 3. Using our consumer power to encourage shops and other businesses
      in Jakarta to use less plastic, and supporting relevant campaigns. 


      <br /> This will give us some time to figure out more organically how we
      want to function, how we best work together, etc before we come to any big
      decisions or start bigger projects that require more clarity on ways of
      working and where we’re going than we currently have.
    question: Q2. What are the group’s long term goals and plans?
  - answer: >-
      Our Facebook group is already a lively place for hosting discussion and
      sharing ideas and resources on how to live more green in Jakarta (e.g.
      composting, cleaning products, recycling, local campaigns, find plastic
      alternatives etc). It’s also become a space for asking questions on green
      living and planning meetups. We’ve also developed our first resources on
      how you can recycle in Jakarta and have launched this website with the
      Jakarta Green List in April 2019. We have also launched a campaign to
      reduce plastic packaging in supermarkets on Change.Org.
    question: Q3. What is the group doing right now?
  - answer: >-
      In the interests of keeping this lovely and lively group all moving in the
      same direction, a few volunteers are taking on coordination
      responsibilities. 


      <br /> Facebook - Vics (admin), Aparna and Erou (moderators)


      <br />Talks, outreach and local partnerships - Susan (English), Malini
      (English, Indonesian) and Erou (English/Indonesian).


      <br /> Online campaigning - Zina


      <br /> Instagram - Savirra


      <br /> Website - Vics, Prachi and Divya


      <br /> These coordinators are responsible for ensuring we have a clear way
      of working and to help streamline communication. Coordinators won't be
      making decisions, more like facilitating the group to make decisions...
      and won't be doing all the work, more like keeping track of who's doing
      what and making sure people have the support they need for what they're
      working on.
    question: Q4. How is Going Green in Jakarta being coordinated?
  - answer: >-
      As a new community that is 100% driven by volunteers we are still finding
      our feet and our ways of working. As we grow, we aspire to live up to the
      following working principles. 


      <br /> (1)  Open and inclusive - we are a diverse group of people living
      in Jakarta. We seek to create a community that is sensitive to cultural
      differences and where all members are valued for their passion, ideas and
      experience.


      <br /> (2) Positive and solution-driven - we want to better understand the
      barriers to going green in Jakarta but will work together to find
      solutions and generate new ideas to overcome challenges.


      <br /> (3) Collaborative and value-adding - we want to work together with
      established local organisations and bodies who are already working on
      green issues and add value/momentum to their work rather than duplicating.


      <br /> (4)  Accountable and supportive. We will hold ourselves accountable
      to what we have committed to, without putting undue stress or pressure on
      people who volunteer to take on responsibilities or projects.


      <br /> Where we fall short of these principles we will listen to feedback
      and commit to find ways of doing it better.
    question: Q5. What kind of community are we?
  - answer: >-
      The WA group is a way for communicating directly and quickly with a
      smaller team of people to better enable the establishment and development
      of Going Green in Jakarta. WA Group conversations are currently in English
      given the international demographic of members. Ask any of the
      coordinators if you would like to join. Anyone can be added to the
      Whatsapp group at anytime if they want to be involved on a day-to-day
      basis.
