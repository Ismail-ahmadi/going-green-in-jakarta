    question: 'Online resources: Our list of online resources'
  - answer: >
      "Back in 2010, I was Vice-President for Europe, Middle-East and Africa for
      an English corporation, which manufactures yeast and bakery ingredients.
      Based in Dublin, I was managing 800 employees spread over 9 countries in
      charge of a 260 million US dollar business, traveling always more.


      In 2012, I felt like having a brand new start, giving a new meaning to my
      life… focused on my humanist values. Like when I was 21 years old. With a
      friend we founded a humanitarian organization at our Business School. Vent
      d’Est (East wind) aimed at supporting Romanian people with medical care,
      books, toys, just after the fall of the Iron curtain. We went to Romania
      twice.


      I realized at that moment how lucky I was and how helping people in need
      was my duty, my path.


      You can have a big impact with very little action. When the Human being is
      your main point of focus, your main value, you feel alive.

      Jeroen van Overbeek"
