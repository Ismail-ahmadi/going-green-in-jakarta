Life on our two tiny paradise islands is simple and good :~) One wouldn’t guess that only two short hours by speedboat from the urban metropolis that is Jakarta, you’d find such a gorgeous and pristine place.  Pulau Macan is a true gem - it was that way before we came to steward it, and we have done our best to keep it that way.

Our vision is to make you feel at home within our beautiful environment while introducing you to some of the solutions we’ve applied to make our world a better place.  Natural building, intelligent energy, water conservation, waste management, coral conservation, community development, and healthful food and beverages are all part of our intended (and sometimes realized) life here.  

What makes it eco friendly?

\- mainly vegetarian; organic where possible; energy efficiency and solar panels; carbon offset; saving water - cold showers! eco toilet; and rain water catchment.
