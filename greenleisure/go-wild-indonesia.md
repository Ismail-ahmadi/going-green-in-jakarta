**GoWild!** **Indonesia** is a non-profit group of volunteers that organises guided trips to places of floral and faunal interest in Indonesia. National parks, forests, conservation sites, and other areas of outstanding natural beauty or species interest are included. Our trips involve gentle strolls, rather than strenuous hikes, and sometimes just sitting in a boat or SUV and watching. They are suitable for all age ranges and families.

We complete 10-12 trips a year ranging from an half day to 10 days duration. We raise an annual trip list in early January then send out each trip itinerary about 4 weeks beforehand.

All attendees and participants in GoWild! events take part entirely at their own risk and this is implicitly understood on an ongoing basis.
