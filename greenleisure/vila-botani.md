Accommodation, hiking, biking, environmental education, yoga & meditation, organic farm and cuisine...

"Less than an hour from the Bogor toll exit and less than two from South Jakarta, Vila Botani is perched on the slopes of Mt Salak. It is far from the nearest kampong and borders on a vast forest. 

"Far from any crowds, this is THE place to refresh your body and mind. Amid an extraordinary tranquility, lounge on your own deck in a jungle lodge, while listening to birdsong, the croaking frogs and the endless rattle of cicadas. Sit under a waterfall as a stream of chill, crystal water cascades over you. Avoid the Puncak's annoying traffic jams. During 2018 and early 2019 Vila Botani upgraded its accommodations to provide more comfort. 

"At the end of a private road, our property of 5.5 ha is ideal for a leisurely stroll. Or - hike or bike in the National Park. Feel free to bring your dog. Vila Botani is pet friendly. "
