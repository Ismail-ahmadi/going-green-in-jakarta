"Java Lava is simply an informal group of like-minded enthusiasts who enjoy climbing mountains in their spare time. Java Lava stands for the idea of bringing people together who enjoy nature, mountains and adventure.

"Java Lava trips are of varying degrees of difficulty and duration â€“ from one-day family walks to extended treks of 10-12 days. Most trips are mountain climbs of 3-4 days often camping on a mountain for one or two nights. "

"Since its beginning, participation has been no more than a mailing list. Everybody who wishes to join is welcome. All participants, including the trip leader, pay their own way at cost for each trip."
