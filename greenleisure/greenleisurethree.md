Here the weather is nice, the view is totally breath-taking, and nature is close enough for you to appreciate it. The air is so clean, fresh and pure. Nothing like the big city we live in for years. Far away from those endless noise and air pollution.

You are so tired of the city being hectic all the time. You wish you could get away from all the routine activities that hooked you up every single day. You would love to have a quality time with your family. Somewhere nice and peaceful, where you can enjoy your meals in between lovely weather, fantastic view, with your kids running around and having fun with their friends.. A total heart warming experience. A perfect holiday or even a weekend getaway. 

Based on these similar concepts, The Pinewood Lodge and Organic Farm were established at 2005. Located at the heart of Cisarua â€“ Puncak, it was a dreamy place with European style. With its natural concept, lots of trees, plus a treehouse, an exciting holiday will be at warranty.
