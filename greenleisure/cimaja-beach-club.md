A family run, boutique resort on the south coast of West Java, just 15 minutes from Pelabuhan Ratu. Whether escaping the hustle and bustle of Indonesia’s capital city, Jakarta, or coming from overseas, CBC provides a fabulous base to explore this beautiful region. No plastic water bottles or straws are used at Cimaja Beach Club. 

Cimaja and the surrounding areas are blessed with world class waves that can handle all kinds of swell sizes and directions. CBC provides surf lessons for beginners, as well as surfboard rental, and we keep our rates as low as possible so that everyone can enjoy the thrill of riding waves.

A train is available twice a day to Cibadak which takes around 3 hours from Jakarta (with a change in Bogor). Then it’s another 2 hours to Cimaja by bus or car from there.
