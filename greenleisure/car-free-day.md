Every Sunday from 6 to 11 a.m., Jalan Sudirman and Jalan Thamrin are closed to all private cars. Thousands flock to the big boulevard to walk, run, cycle and skate or simply to stroll leisurely, enjoying the street food, circus-like displays and occasional public events.

Originally started as a government initiative to help reduce pollution, car free day on Sudirman and Thamrin has become a well-loved Jakarta tradition, an opportunity for city folk to get up early and get active in the company of many, many like minds and bodies. 

For a few hours, once a week, you get to truly enjoy being outdoors in Jakarta.
