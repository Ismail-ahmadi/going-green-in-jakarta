**What Green Initiative Foundation says ...**

"We’re working with the Sarongge community to produce and deliver organic veg baskets to homes throughout Jakarta every Wednesday. Choose a size of box to suit you and your family and every week you’ll get a selection of delicious vegetables delivered to your home or office.

By cutting out the middle men, we’re able to give the farmers a great, reliable source of income, whilst still providing fresh (as in, harvested yesterday!) veg to our consumers at a great price. What’s even better is that the profits we make go straight back to GIF, helping us to continue and expand our community-based environmental protection projects."
