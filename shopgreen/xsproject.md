XSProject is a non-profit organization that works to improve the lives of poor families living in trash picker communities at the Cirendeu open garbage dump in South Jakarta.

XSProject buys non-biodegradable plastic consumer trash from Jakarta's trash picker community. They don't usually pick up this kind of plastic because they can't sell it to a conventional recycler. We also seek corporate donations of waste materials such as used highway billboards, advertising banners, flags and auto upholstery.

\- cosmetic pouches, laptop cases, shopping bags, customised products all made from upcycled plastic.
