It is a fermenting container that processes food waste with probiotic microorganisms (included in starter kit). This is an anaerobic process, producing no greenhouse gases as regular composting would. Once it is fermented and saturated, the scraps can be mixed with soil and it will breakdown, resulting as a rich and nutritious compost.”
