Based in Jakarta, Osem is a sustainable fashion brand which only uses the natural color that is produced from Indigofera Tinctoria plant. The brandâ€™s products also use only natural fibers, such as cotton, linen, hemp, etc. As well as designed with the zero-waste or less-waste planning. Osem collaborates with other labels to recycle the fabric waste. In addition to minimize the waste, Osem is not using zippers and buttons made from plastic.
