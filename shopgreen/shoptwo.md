**What Avani Eco says ...**

"Avani was established in the year of 2014 spearheaded by individuals who strive to be difference makers utilizing technology as solutions to combat the global plastic epidemic. Avani provides eco-friendly inimitable bio-cassava bag made from industrial grade cassava starch and other natural ingredients, complimented with a full range of sustainable food packaging and hospitality products made from renewable resources.

Through years of preparation prior to its launch, Avani has successfully embarked on its mission to replace disposable plastic products which take hundreds and even thousands of years to be decomposed by Mother nature by using renewable resources made from plants. Parallel to that, placing sustainability as its core business values, Avani is committed to exercise good corporate governance by adopting the Triple Bottom Line approach in assuring the sustainability of its business.
