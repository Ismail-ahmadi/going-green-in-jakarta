The Jakarta-based shoe brand contributes to the eco-friendly lifestyle by producing vegan shoes. The main concept is basically cruelty-free shoes which made of vegan suede, vegan leather, or other substitute leather. Haku also uses Ultrasuede fabric which made of pre-consumer waste. Reuse the vinyl to minimalize the nonbiodegradable products being waste in the soil. Haku was born to create shoes that fit womenâ€™s lives with ease and reflects their personal feminine identities.
