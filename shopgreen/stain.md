Eco-conscious, embracing the relationship between design and sustainability, we design garments made of recycled fabrics, conceptualizing and designing both textiles and silhouettes. Every garment is made in Indonesia where we work closely with local artisans to perfect each piece with attention to detail. We create timeless everyday pieces – pieces that can be worn from an urban landscape to a tropical paradise, from work to happy hour – carefully designed for all to wear and own for years.

Stain takes pride in following the slow fashion approach. We consider and value our process, the resources we use and the local artisans that we work with in creating our collections. This is to ensure that our customers will not only have good quality garments that will last long, but also to keep them mindful of the fair treatment of the community we work with and the planet we live on.
