At Greenery, we proudly advocate all natural, organic, no preservatives, no MSG, no artificial or coloring to deliver great quality. The menu features local, beautiful ingredients, from light bites to more hearty options. The collaborations allow for each ingredient to shine, from plate to palate, with earthy vegetables, fresh fish, and succulent meats. Greenery applies no deep-fry, minimum amount of salt and oil, no butter, mayo, refined sugar, no artificial colorings, flavorings, and no preservatives. All products are homemade and freshly made in small batches.‚Äù

They also use biodegradable cassava straws for dine-in and cassava bags for their Go Food orders. However, please note these are not compostable and require treatment in a specialised recycling facility.
