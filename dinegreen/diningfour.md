**Jakarta Post says…**  “Having been around for more than 20 years, Dharma Kitchen is one of the longest-serving vegetarian restaurants in Jakarta. The outlets are currently located in Central Park shopping mall in West Jakarta and Pluit, North Jakarta. Here, you can find Asian, Indonesian and Western dishes, such as simulated roast duck, rendang and chicken burger. For the dishes, Dharma Kitchen uses meat substitutes made of mushroom or soy. Almost 90 percent of the menu is vegan-friendly, as the eatery rarely uses honey, milk or eggs.

**Where:** Jl Pluit Kencana Raya No. 106-110\
**Opening hours:** 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. (mut)
