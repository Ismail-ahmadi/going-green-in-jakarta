Owner Talita Setyadi says, “What we’re trying to do is to help to change one habit at a time. We’re not asking people \[to be] vegetarian, but \[perhaps] flexitarian.” 

“Dej serves delectable vegetarian dishes, such as sesame-crusted tofu, beet hummus, rainbow frittata, green veggie lasagna, as well as green lentil salad and quinoa veggie marinara, and Talita’s forte, breads and cakes. Some of the menu is also vegan friendly” 

Where: Jl. Bumi No. 20, South Jakarta\
Opening hours: 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
