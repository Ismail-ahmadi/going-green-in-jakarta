**Jakarta Post says:** “Plantubi is a home business without an outlet. However, the brand has caught health enthusiasts’ attention as it serves plant-based dishes with local flavors, namely the Padang bowl and Sunda bowl, nasi jagung (corn rice) and rendang jamur (mushroom cooked rendang-style). Priced at Rp 48,000 per bowl, the menu is also vegan friendly as it does not use eggs, butter or dairy.”
