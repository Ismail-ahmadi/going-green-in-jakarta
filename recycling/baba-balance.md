**What Baba Balance says ...**

"We offer brilliant beautiful handmade recycled product. The basic material of our product is plastic. This plastic is collected from the street, landfills, and waterways of Jakarta (Indonesia). With human effort, this plastic is washed, designed, and sewn to transform it into beautiful handmade products, such as bags, umbrellas, wallets, organizer books, laundry baskets, tissue box, travel gear, etc."
