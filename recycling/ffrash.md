It is an upcycling project which was initiated by a Dutch designer Gina Provo Kluit in Jakarta, with an aim to design a collection of interior products, by re-using waste material. Every Ffrash collection is created by internationally well-known Dutch designers and handcrafted by the street children of a non-profit organization KDM. Ffrash trains less fortunate kids to become green furniture makers and entrepreneurs themselves, demonstrating that Indonesian street children have the potential to become skilled workers who can turn trash into beautiful and functional products. All revenues from the products are invested in the Ffrash artisans and in the development and care of these former street children.
