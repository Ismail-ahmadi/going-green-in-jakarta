Bank Sampah (Waste Banks) is a waste management program initiated and developed by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (KLHK). There are approximately 5,244 waste bank units spread in 34 provinces and 219 regencies/ cities in Indonesia.

All the waste bank units are supported by the government but mainly run by the community/ individuals, who must be legally approved and registered with the Bank Sampah at Kelurahan (sub-district) level. Bank Sampah is a collective synergy of government, community, Yayasan LSM (Lembaga Swadaya Masyarakat) and manufacturers like Unilever & Danone, who are responsible for their own packaging wastes.

It is quite similar to a bank, where an individual/ residence can open their account at the local bank sampah unit and get a savings book. Every time the individual/ housing complex gives the sorted inorganic waste, the weight and value of the trash gets recorded in the savings book. You can get the permission from your building management for the scheduled pick ups or drop off your trash at the local waste bank unit. The collected trash will be transported to various factories for recycling process.
