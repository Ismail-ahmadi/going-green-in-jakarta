XSProject is a non-profit organization that works to improve the lives of poor families living in Jakartaâ€™s trash picker communities. Indonesia is changing and rural communities are being displaced. People move their families to big cities like Jakarta in search of work. With few financial resources, little education and no documentation, many have found themselves living in over-flowing garbage dumps.

Each day it is estimated there are about 450,000 trash pickers working in this city of 13 million people. They pick through the garbage, exposing themselves to infectious diseases and hazardous waste, looking for anything they can sell. By day's end, their efforts might return around US$4 - barely enough to feed their families.

 XSProject buys non-biodegradable plastic consumer trash from Jakarta's trash picker community. They don't usually pick up this kind of plastic because they can't sell it to a conventional recycler. We also seek corporate donations of waste materials such as used highway billboards, advertising banners, flags and auto upholstery.
