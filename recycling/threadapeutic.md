“Threadapeutic has been committed to sustainable textile innovation since our inception in 2015. We craft contemporary bags, accessories, and soft furnishings out of leftover fabric from the fashion industry as well as post event banners. No two creations are alike - just like you. We envision a creative circular economy where no waste is left behind.”
