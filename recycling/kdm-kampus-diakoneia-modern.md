Yayasan KDM is a non profit organization which provides various programs and services for street and marginalized children. Established in 1972, KDM aims to promote and fulfill children rights and protection through their programs like rescue, advocacy, dormitory, and alternative education.

The Green Project – is an initiative by the KDM students and alumni to set-up a recycling collection scheme which offers a solution to Jakarta’s waste problem, while benefitting its work in supporting the development of street children into independent, educated and skilled young adults.
