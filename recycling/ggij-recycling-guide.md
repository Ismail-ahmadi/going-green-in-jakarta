[This toolkit ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nc4gv8sD1uQ8yBfx87f4c4ybdqsDtL98/view)has been prepared by Prachi Garg on behalf of Going Green in Jakarta, based on the experiences of our members in getting their compounds or apartment blocks to recycle more, thereby reducing the amount of waste going to landfill or polluting rivers and oceans. However, we believe that recycling is not the most important part of waste management. For ideas and inspiration on how to reduce or reuse materials like plastic use at home please join our community on Facebook (www.facebook.com/groups/GGJakarta).

We hope to keep the document updated with more tips or experiences in the future so if you have experience to share please get in touch.
