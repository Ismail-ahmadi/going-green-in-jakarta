**What Topiku Store says ...**

" We work together with local trash-pickers or pemulung to salvage HDPE plastics from landfills, typically found in buckets. Once collected, they are shredded, washed, and sun-dried. We then pour the shards into a machine that melts and remoulds the sturdy-but-flexible material into brims – fully bendable to fit your head. The world’s first real bucket hat."
