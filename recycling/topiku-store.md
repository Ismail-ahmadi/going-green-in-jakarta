**What Topiku Store says ...**

" We work together with local trash-pickers or pemulung to salvage HDPE plastics from landfills, typically found in buckets.

Once collected, they are shredded, washed, and sun-dried.


We then pour the shards into a machine that melts and remolds the sturdy-but-flexible material into brims – fully bendable to fit your head.


The world’s first real bucket hat."
