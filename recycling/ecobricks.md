**What Ecobricks says ...**

"We’re a collective of community leaders from around the world united in a vision of planetary transition: a shift from plastic to ever greener harmony with Earth’s cycles. We share the belief that ‘the problem is always the solution’ and that facing our plastic is fundamental to moving on from plastic and the systems behind it. We make ecobricks in our homes, and share ecobricking in our communities. To support fellow ecobrickers around the world, we’ve come together as the Global Ecobrick Alliance Earth Enterprise. Our mission is to craft and to hold the philosophical and technical infrastructure for the global and local ecobrick movements. As the movement spreads, as the rusted mind forged manacles of consumption and capital crack, our ecobricks are laying the foundation for the beautiful world we all know is possible."
