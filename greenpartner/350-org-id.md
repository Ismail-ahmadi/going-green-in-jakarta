350.org * builds a grassroots-based global climate movement to ensure our leaders understand and take responsibility for the reality of science and the principles of justice. This movement developed from ordinary people throughout the world, who united to realize solutions and ensure a better future for everyone. A number of online campaigns, organizing at the grassroots level and mass actions in the public sphere that we have carried out have actively united our networks in more than 188 countries, including Indonesia. 

"350.org **Climate Rangers** encourage young people to play their roles and make the best use of their time by contributing ideas and taking concrete actions together to encourage a fair and immediate energy transition towards 100% renewable energy.
