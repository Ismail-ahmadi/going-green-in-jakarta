"We are a team of nature-respecting entrepreneurs, enthusiastic in growing a business that can support various aspects and efforts to reduce wastes. “Navakara” is derived from sanskrit words of “na” (no) and “avakara” (waste). And as “mitra” means partner also in Sanskrit, the company is thriving to be the best partner of zero waste solutions to those who share the same care about the environmental issues.

The company Mitra Solusi Navakara is founded by four friends who like to think and push further on how to raise awareness of our environmental degrading issues.

Living healthy, safe, and comfortable, where the abundance of the natural earth is also conserved and protected, is the “conscious living” that the founders are supportive of.

The founders’ combined education, expertise and years of experiences in sales, marketing, retail, wholesale, and international trading are also what relevant to understanding the challenges and opportunities to enter new markets. "
