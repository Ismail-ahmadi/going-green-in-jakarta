Divers Clean Action (DCA) is a youth NGO and community focusing on marine debris issues based in Jakarta.

We've been researching on marine debris data with various partner universities, coastal community development facilitators, environmental collaborating program with diving institutions, campaigns and training since late 2015 with more than 1000 volunteers across Indonesia. We're really excited to gather and collaborate to have a bigger and wider impact of good actions!
