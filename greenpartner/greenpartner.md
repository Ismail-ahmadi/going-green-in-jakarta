**What Trash Hero Indonesia says ...**

"The Trash Hero mission is to bring communities together to clean and reduce waste. We do this through:

Action and Awareness. We pick up trash. Whether a cigarette butt on the sand, or 2000 km from an island beach – if we see it, we clean it! And we motivate others to do the same. By spending a few hours together picking up trash, people gain a profound understanding of the consequences of being careless about waste.

Education. We actively engage children through our multilingual kids’ program, connecting environmental values with hands-on experience of the impact that trash has on the local and global environment. Adults also learn experientially, backed up with information and workshops provided by our volunteers.

Sustainable Projects. We create long-term programs that help communities  to remove and better manage their waste, and strategies that will reduce the amount of waste being produced in the future.

Inspiration. We motivate people to become Trash Heroes in their everyday lives. With consistently positive messaging, and a philosophy of “small steps”, we remove the barriers to change. Trash Hero volunteers have gone home to make their own heroic clean-ups around the world.

Trash Hero believes that every one of us can be a Trash Hero. Read more about our projects, and join this global movement today."
