It is represented in 27 provinces and has over 471 member organisations and 156 personal member (as of April 2011). It stands for social transformation, peoples sovereignty, and sustainability of life and livelihoods. WALHI works to defend Indonesiaâ€™s natural world and local communities from injustice carried out in the name of economic development.

"We work across Indonesia on a variety of issues including: forests, mining, fresh water management, pollution, foreign debt and corporate-driven globalization, coasts and oceans, disaster management, national policy and law reform, and good governance. We also work to ensure adequate legal representation for various community groups in their struggles to gain justice.
