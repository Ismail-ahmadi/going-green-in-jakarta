We realised food waste is a big issue in Indonesia. we are ranked second largest food waster globally. Surplus food from wedding parties, corporate functions & lunch provisions, perfectly imperfect plantation produce, government shelf life regulations, emerging food retailers, domestic food behaviours, logistics and infrastructure issues contributed to 300kg per person in average of food waste per annum. At the same time we also found a hard yet simple fact that many are still in need of food and suffer from hunger before they sleep. 19.4 million people in Indonesia remain undernourished (source: FAO.org - 2016)

Food Cycle implements 3 levels approach

1. Re-Distribute - FoodCycle collects untouched surplus food from local parties and events, food retailers and hospitality providers and coordinate distribution to the local pre-welfare areas to feed hungry children, the elderly and the disadvantaged families

2. Re-Process - FoodCycle collects imperfectly perfect produce from local plantations / food distributors and shelf life sensitive-not expired products from food manufacturers, and upcycle those products to become a marketable quality food products

3. Re-Cycle - FoodCycle will collect organic waste from food manufacturers, corporate buildings, shopping malls, apartments, residentials and convert them to be animal feed and compost fertilizer
