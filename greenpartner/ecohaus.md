"We are an environmental community hub connecting various environmental NGOs, diverse organizations (foundation/institution) and non profits, as well as communities with conscious mindset, to share, discuss, collaborate and explore ideas on sustainable lifestyle and have a goal to push positive footprints and impacts for our children through awareness, workshops and events.

CoHaus co-living space in Jakarta is our 1st basecamp where we host our events, talks and meet ups for environmental issues with various foundations and communities to get connected with one another.
